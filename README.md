# Advent Of Code 2023
Participation in the programming puzzles [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).

The test input is in `dNN.in`, download the real input to `dNN.test`. Change the path at the end of `dNN.py`.

To run, simply: `python dayNN/dNN.py`. Some later days support printing debug message, to remove the message: `python -O dayNN/dNN.py`

Not tested, but most code is compatible with pypy3.
